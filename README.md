# Traffic Light Controller

This project was programmed on an STM32F446 board as a university course project for Microcontroller System Design. A traffic light controller was created to be used at an intersection. It has both urban and rural settings with a mode switch. A crosswalk counts down when the perpendicular section is on RED.
