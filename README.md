# Traffic Light Controller

## Introduction

Welcome to the Traffic Light Controller project! This was a project started from the Microcontroller Systems Design class I took at SUNY New Paltz with Andrew, Yiwen, and myself. The final report is attached to this repository, documenting our entire process. It also includes our code. Thanks for reading!
